    "Bee Movie is a 2007 American computer-animated comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and starring Jerry Seinfeld. The film centers on Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld), a honey bee who tries to sue the human race for exploiting bees after learning from his florist friend Vanessa Bloome (Zellweger) that humans sell and consume honey.

    "Your bee studies class (BEE 210) has tasked you with homework telling you to break down the script of the movie. They have asked you to provide the following things:\n",
    "- A text file giving every word that appears in the film, along with the frequency of each word (return a dictionary as well) **NOTE:** Try to replace as much punctuation as you can, this includes question marks, periods, and colons.\n",
    "- Output the top ten words which appeared in the film along with their frequencies\n",
    "- Output giving the number of times the characters: Bee Gandhi, Ralph Lauren, Larry King, and bejesus appear in the script. If a character did not appear in the script, catch the error and output a nice sentance telling the user that the character did not appear."
