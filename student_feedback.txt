"Our TA is a good guy. He made his office hour hybrid which is convenient for the students. Besides, he clearly organized his recitation and tried to review all the stuff we learned in the previous week, which helped me a lot. He tried to activate the recitation and he would response your question patiently." - Fall 2022
