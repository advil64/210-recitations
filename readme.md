## About Me

Hi there, my name is Advith Chegu and I had the privilege of being a TA for Rutgers CS 210 in the Fall of 2023. This was my second time being a TA in this particular class, and this time I decided to open source all the recitation materials that I made for this class. 

## The Goal

The aim of these notebooks is to be educational while also having fun! My aim with the class was to make is to make it as accessible as possible. This means that if a student with a liberal arts background wanted to pick up a couple of data science skills, they should feel welcomed and comfortable with learning the concepts. I hope that whoever finds this humble repo has a great time with it and please [email me](mailto:advil64@gmail.com) if you have feedback.
