    "### Problem 1: Age Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "You just got hired by Meta, congrats on your new job! Your first task is to write a function called `check_age()` that given the birthday of the user, returns a boolean indicating if they are over 25 or not. The birthday of the user is entered in the following format `mm-dd-yyyy`, if the format is incorrect your function needs to raise a `ValueError`. To get the current date, follow the directions here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-current-date-using-python/... or hardcode it if you're feeling lazy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy**: First solve the problem by just looking at the year and subtracting the given year from the current one, this solution is given in the answer below\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hard**: Someone who is 25 years old is approximately 9131 days old, check if the difference between the current date and the given date is that many days, this problem is to be solved as a challenge by the students, you must take into consideration leap years as well as difference in days in a month. Inspired by: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-days-between-two-dates/description/"

    "#### Problem 2: Playlist Deduplicator\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't you just hate having duplicate songs in your Spotify playlists :\\( Ugh, if only someone could implement a deduplicator where given a list of songs in the playlist the function returns a new list without duplicates... Maybe they can call the function `playlist_dedup()` and if the argument is not a list of strings throw a `ValueError` ðŸ’¡! \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The original order must be preserved, the list should be in the same order as before but just without the duplicated songs. The first duplicate instance of the song is the one to be removed, for example below the song \"Alice\" is repeated twice, so the second instance is removed. If \"Alice\" was repeated more times then those would be removed too.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hard**: To make the problem tougher, students are encouraged to write a song class which has values for the artist, name, duration, and other attributes, then build an equals function into the class in order to do a more thorough comparison of songs rather than just comparing by song names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Even Harder**: Try to cut down on the time complexity as much as possible, maybe sorting the playlist first can help you out?\n",
