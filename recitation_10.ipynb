    "\n",
    "- **Categorical Data:** Bar plots are *usually* used for displaying the distribution of categorical data. The x-axis represents different categories, and the y-axis represents the frequency, count, or other aggregated measure associated with each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discrete Data:** Bar plots are suitable for discrete data, where each category is distinct and separate. The categories are typically non-numeric and represent different groups or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spacing Between Bars:** There is usually space between adjacent bars in a bar plot because each bar represents a distinct category. For all intents and purposes this is the easiest way to differentiate between the two!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Bins:** Bar plots don't involve binning of data. Each category gets its own bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Histogram:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numeric Data:** Histograms are used for displaying the distribution of numeric data. The x-axis represents the range of values (divided into bins), and the y-axis represents the frequency or probability of occurrence within each bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous Data:** Histograms are suitable for continuous data where the values can fall within a range. The data is divided into bins, and the height of each bar represents the frequency or density of data points within that bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous Distribution:** Histograms show the continuity of the distribution. There's no gap between adjacent bars because the data is continuous, and each bar represents a range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binning:** Histograms involve binning the data into intervals or bins. The height of each bar reflects the number of data points falling within that bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the key difference lies in the type of data they are used to represent and how that data is structured. Bar plots are suitable for categorical and discrete data, while histograms are designed for visualizing the distribution of continuous numerical data. However in today's world they are often used interchangeably."
