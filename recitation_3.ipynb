    "Bee Movie is a 2007 American computer-animated comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and starring Jerry Seinfeld. The film centers on Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld), a honey bee who tries to sue the human race for exploiting bees after learning from his florist friend Vanessa Bloome (Zellweger) that humans sell and consume honey.

    "- A text file giving every word that appears in the film, along with the frequency of each word (return a dictionary as well) **NOTE:** Try to replace as much punctuation as you can, this includes question marks, periods, and colons.\n",
    "- Output the top ten words which appeared in the film along with their frequencies\n",
    "- Output giving the number of times the characters: Bee Gandhi, Ralph Lauren, Larry King, and bejesus appear in the script. If a character did not appear in the script, catch the error and output a nice sentance telling the user that the character did not appear."
